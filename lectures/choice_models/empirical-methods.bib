 abstract = {In a seminal paper Abadie et al (2010) develop the synthetic control procedure for estimating the effect of a treatment, in the presence of a single treated unit and a number of control units, with pre-treatment outcomes observed for all units. The method constructs a set of weights such that covariates and  pre-treatment outcomes of the treated unit are approximately matched by a weighted average of control units. The weights are  restricted to be nonnegative and sum to one, which allows the procedure to obtain the weights even when the number of lagged outcomes is modest relative to the number of control units, a setting that is not uncommon in applications.  In the current paper we propose a more general class of synthetic control estimators that allows researchers to relax some of the restrictions in the ADH method. We allow the weights to be negative, do not necessarily restrict the sum of the weights, and allow for a permanent additive difference between the treated unit and the controls, similar to difference-in-difference procedures. The weights directly minimize the distance between the lagged outcomes for the treated and the control units, using regularization methods to deal with a potentially large number of possible control units.},

	title = {Why Propensity Scores Should Not Be Used for Matching},
	journal = {Political Analysis},
	year = {Forthcoming},
	abstract = {We show that propensity score matching (PSM), an enormously popular method of preprocessing data for causal inference, often accomplishes the opposite of its intended goal --- thus increasing imbalance, inefficiency, model dependence, and bias. The weakness of PSM comes from its attempts to approximate a completely randomized experiment, rather than, as with other matching methods, a more efficient fully blocked randomized experiment. PSM is thus uniquely blind to the often large portion of imbalance that can be eliminated by approximating full blocking with other matching methods. Moreover, in data balanced enough to approximate complete randomization, either to begin with or after pruning some observations, PSM approximates random matching which, we show, increases imbalance even relative to the original data. Although these results suggest researchers replace PSM with one of the other available matching methods, propensity scores have other productive uses.},

Estimators of $\beta$ based on incorrect parameterization of \texttheta{} are generally inconsistent, whereas consistent nonparametric estimators deviate from $\beta$ by a larger probability order than N\textsuperscript{-1/2}, where N is sample size. An estimator generalizing the ordinary least squares estimator of $\beta$ is constructed by inserting nonparametric regression estimators in the nonlinear orthogonal projection on Z. Under regularity conditions $\beta$\^ is shown to be $<$tex-math$>$\$N\^\{1/2\}$\backslash$text\{-consistent\}\$$<$/tex-math$>$ for $\beta$ and asymptotically normal, and a consistent estimator of its limiting covariance matrix is given, affording statistical inference that is not only asymptotically valid but has nonzero asymptotic first-order efficiency relative to estimators based on a correctly parameterized \texttheta. We discuss the identification problem and $\beta$\^'s efficiency, and report results of a Monte Carlo study of finite-sample performance. While the paper focuses on the simplest interesting setting of multiple regression with independent observations, extensions to other econometric models are described, in particular seemingly unrelated and nonlinear regressions, simultaneous equations, distributed lags, and sample selectivity models.]},

Considering first-price sealed-bid auction models within the independent private value paradigm, we show that the underlying distribution of bidders' private values is identified from observed bids and the number of actual bidders without any parametric assumptions. Using the theory of minimax, we establish the best rate of uniform convergence at which the latent density of private values can be estimated nonparametrically from available data. We then propose a two-step kernel-based estimator that converges at the optimal rate.},

This chapter surveys some of the recent literature on semiparametric methods, emphasizing microeconometric applications using limited dependent variable models. An introductory section defines semiparametric models more precisely and reviews the techniques used to derive the large-sample properties of the corresponding estimation methods. The next section describes a number of weak restrictions on error distributions \textemdash{} conditional mean, conditional quantile, conditional symmetry, independence, and index restrictions \textemdash{} and show how they can be used to derive identifying restrictions on the distributions of observables. This general discussion is followed by a survey of a number of specific estimators proposed for particular econometric models, and the chapter concludes with a brief account of applications of these methods in practice.},
